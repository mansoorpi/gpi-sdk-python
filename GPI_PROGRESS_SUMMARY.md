# GPI Project Progress Summary

## Completed
- Fixed context extraction bug in the BAPI chat interface
- Updated the `ContextManager` import in `gpi/__init__.py` to use the correct implementation
- Improved the `Broker` class to handle cases where no context is available
- Added robust error handling to the server API
- Added the ability to register agents directly through the API
- Implemented auto-context extraction for all interfaces
- Created the simple BAPI server that runs on port 8080
- Added debug endpoints for diagnostic information

## Current State
- The BAPI server is fully functional and can be run with: `python examples/run_simple_bapi.py`
- Agents can be registered via the API with: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Agent Name", "id": "agent_id", "abilities": ["ability1"]}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/agents`
- Agent and context information can be viewed via the debug endpoint: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/debug`
- Auto-context extraction is working correctly in the BAPI chat interface

## Next Steps
- Implement comprehensive documentation in the documentation tab
- Add more robust error handling for external agent integration
- Enhance context extraction to better identify abilities from the message context
- Implement more sophisticated agent selection logic in the broker
- Add support for more LLM models and integrations
- Consider adding unit tests for the core functionality

## Current Issues
- Need to be aware that server state is not persistent across restarts
- The agent created in a separate script doesn't persist in the server process
- Port 5000 conflicts with AirPlay on macOS, so we're using port 8080 instead

## Command Reference
- Start the server: `python examples/run_simple_bapi.py`
- Create an agent: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Weather Agent", "id": "weather", "abilities": ["weather"]}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/agents`
- Send a message: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "What is the weather like in San Francisco?", "use_llm": true}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/bapi`
- View debug info: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/debug`
- Get context: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/context?user_id=default`
